        Description: |-
            Republics are governments that are led by a head of state who is usually elected. The head of state, often called the President, serves for a set term, after which a new president is elected. While the president is elected, this may actually happen indirectly, where a council of some sort is elected by the people, and this council then elects a president. In many respects Republics are similar to Democracies and usually hold comparable ideals.

            Citizens of Republics typically enjoy many freedoms and liberties. Republics invariably divide governmental power carefully between the executive, legislative and judicial areas. The president controls the executive area, while other elected representatives control the legislative area. The courts control the judicial area.

        Description: |-
            Mercantile Guild governments are highly focussed towards commerce, trade and
            industry. The ruling structure is often loose and informal - a collection of leading
            members of the business community make key decisions that affect all citizens.

            Mercantile Guilds generally allow a high degree of freedom and autonomy to their
            citizens. Basic rights and liberties are guaranteed by a simple set of laws that can
            apply to many situations. Entrepreneurial activity is very common, creating a dynamic
            business environment where high levels of wealth are generated quickly.

        GovernmentId: 2 #Democracy
        Description: |-
            Democratic governments draw their power from the people that live under them. Competitive elections are held to select representatives who rule for a specified period.

            Citizens of democratic governments enjoy universally recognized freedoms and
            liberties including freedom of political expression, freedom of speech and freedom of
            the press. Democratic governments typically also uphold other important principles
            such as equality before the law, due process and civil liberties.

        Description: |-
            Feudalisms are governments that rely on a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility. In its most basic essence, Feudalism is the granting of land and rights in return for military service.

            Under Feudalistic governments a noble class effectively forms a ruling council. They grant rights and freedoms to the common people in exchange for military support
            from them.

            Feudalistic societies give heavy emphasis to hierarchy and rank. Their social structures are typically very static. Everyone has their predefined place in society - they submit to their local chief.

        Description: |-
            Monarchies invest supreme power in an individual (the Monarch) who is the head of
            state, often for life or until abdication. Monarchies are usually hereditary, with a child
            of the Monarch inheriting power on the death of their parent.

            Monarchs may rule with absolute power, or they may share power with a ruling council
            of nobles or elected representatives.

        Description: |-
            Military Dictatorship is an autocratic form of absolute rule that is unrestricted by law, constitutions, or other social and political factors.

            Military Dictatorships regulate nearly every aspect of the public and private behavior
            of their subjects. Their political, social and civil structure is tuned towards military concerns and warfare. These types of governments are typically concerned with conquest
            and expansion.

        Description: |-
            Technocratic governments place engineers, scientists and technical experts in control. Decision makers are selected based upon how knowledgeable and capable they are.

            Technocracies are typically highly efficient and free from corruption. However they
            often enforce tight control over their citizens' behaviour. This loss of personal freedom
            can sometimes lead to unrest.

        GovernmentId: 7 #Hive Mind
        Description: |-
            Hive Mind governments can be formed by alien races that have a natural telepathic
            ability. The prime value is loyalty to the community as a whole - individual expression
            and freedom is suppressed for this greater common good.

            In Hive Minds all work is divided amongst distinct social castes. Some castes are responsible for food production, others for defense, while others care for
            administration. In some alien societies even reproduction is specialized to a small
            caste, with one or more "queens" producing each new generation.
